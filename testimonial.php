										<div class="testimonials">AIESEC has allowed me to meet beautiful amazing children in India, meet dozens of Africans in Mozambique, explore the power of youth in Moscow and walk the talk in Cape Town. While doing this I have learnt so much about what it means to change the world, to work in teams, to have a purpose and to want to achieve something great.</div>

										<div class="testimonials">The future belongs to those who see possibilities before they become obvious. In AIESEC I lead teams of more than 30 individuals, handled the operations of AIESEC in South Africa, interacted with the world's elite, worked at a global level and much more. I gained experience in Human Rosrouces, Marketing, Branding, Operational Strategies and Public Relations. I am an AIESECer & I wish to remain one.</div>
